NHL League Tornament


- Picked 16 teams from 2019 NHL Play off league.
- Used shuffle team matching. 
- Winner decided by scoring 4 ( Used random number comparision and ignored same number, so no draw game, it goes 4 to 7 matches)
- Used Fade in/out animation
- When start, get all the results then display by button( wasted several hours to get results by button click (set state)...at the begining, so stopped and reconstructed from the scratch .. main reason this took long. ;;)
- Not ugly interface.( doesn't mean preety..)
